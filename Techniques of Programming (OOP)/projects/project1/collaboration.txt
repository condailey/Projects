            Read these helpful webpages that explained to me that I wasn't able to 
            view the picture window because I was testing the program remotely 
            and not in the computer lab where it displays properly. Tried resolving
            the issue initially by attempting to view it from my laptop but confirmed
            my suspicions when testing my program in the lab.
