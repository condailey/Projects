James Gosling, a Canadian computer scientist, is best known for his
invention of the Java programming language while working at Sun
Microsystems in 1994. 

So yes, the answer to question 2 is "James Gosling", and you should
write that in your lab1.txt file.

To solve the next puzzle, look in the file named after the winner of
the the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Turing Award for
2008. This file is somewhere inside the "awards" directory. You can
change into a directory by typing:

   cd awards

Then use a combination of commands like:

    ls
    cat someFile.txt
    cd someDirectory

If you get lost and need to start over, you can type `cd` by itself to
get back to your home directory.
