John Von Neumann was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist,
computer scientist, engineer and polymath. Von Neumann was generally
regarded as the foremost mathematician of his time. 

While consulting for the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the
University of Pennsylvania on the EDVAC project, von Neumann wrote an
incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, describing a computer
architecture in which the data and the program are both stored in the
computer's memory in the same address space. This architecture is the
basis of most modern computer designs.
