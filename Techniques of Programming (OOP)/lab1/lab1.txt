Assignment: CSCI 131, Lab 1
Lab Partners: [ just list the people you worked with for this lab ]

Question 1: Alan Turing [ your responses go here ]
Question 2: James Gosling
Question 3: Barbara Liskov
Question 4: Rev. McFarland
Question 5: "Hello, World!"
Question 6: The reason because the program is only printing two lines of code is because of difference between system.out.print and system.out.println. It appears that the second line of the four is where the user input is manipulated and thus processed in the program. The third line of the program experiences no change is remains constant and prints out on the first line or ln. The fourth line, like the third, is constant and doesn't change with a given input. Since the "ln" for the fourth line is preceded by the standard "system.out.print" it tells the computer to go to the next line in order to print in the terminal.
Question 7: cd ~/labs/lab1
	    ls
	    rm Hello.class
	    rm Greeting.class

Question 8: cd 
	    mkdir ~/examples
	    mv examples ~/Desktop
	    cp Greeting.java ~/examples
	    cp Hello.java ~/examples
