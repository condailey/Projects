Alan Turing is often considered to be the father of modern computer
science. His work on code-breaking for the Brittish during World War
II was depicted in the movie "The Imitation Game". Along with many
other gay men, Turing was persecution by the Britsh government after
the war, leading to his death in 1954 at age 41. Recently, the British
government apologized for the "horrifying" and "utterly unfair"
treatment he received, and in 2021 it honored Turing by making him the
face of the UK's new 50-pound bank note.
