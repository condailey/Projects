//
// This program simulates a simplified and modified "Yahtzee"-like game between
// two players. The program first prompts the user to input the names of the
// players and how many rounds the game should last. It then simulates the game,
// which consists of multiple rounds of rolling dice and awarding prizes. The
// simulated game ends after the requested number of rounds.
// After the game, the winner is printed, and the user is asked whether to run
// another simulation.
